# Automated Tutoring AI System

An LLM-powered automated tutoring program that will converse with you on any given branch of topics (technical or soft). Has practical uses for Quantitative training in Finance, Economics training in Investment Banking, Software Engineering, or Data Science. Can teach basic STEM topics as well as the arts and humanities. 

Has fundamental ability for more diverse conversational tools such as medical or psychological diagnosis - with some changes made to the interview.py backend. 

In current python.py file, feel free to use your own GPT-4 and ElevenLabs APIs to test the program. If you'd like to run locally, either run inference with your own models or request a quantized CPU-focused LLM, speech recognition, and speech synthesis models by direct messaging me. Much of the basic features were inspired by my previous "Alfred" home assistant project, which you may also find in my github. 

Enter your OPENAI and ElevenLabs API Keys into the os environment.

Run the interview.py program to begin. Ensure your microphone is  set up as your system's main audio input.
