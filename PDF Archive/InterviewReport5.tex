\item[Reference Solution: ]%
To find the critical points of the function f(x, y) = x\^{}2 + y\^{}2 and determine their nature, we will follow these steps: \textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}n1. Find the first partial derivatives of f with respect to x and y.\textbackslash{}n2. Set the first partial derivatives equal to zero and solve for x and y to find the critical points.\textbackslash{}n3. Use the second partial derivative test to determine the nature of the critical points.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nStep 1: Calculate the first partial derivatives.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nf\_x = âˆ‚f/âˆ‚x = 2x\textbackslash{}nf\_y = âˆ‚f/âˆ‚y = 2y\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nStep 2: Find the critical points by setting f\_x and f\_y equal to 0.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}n2x = 0 => x = 0\textbackslash{}n2y = 0 => y = 0\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nThe critical point is (0, 0).\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nStep 3: Apply the second partial derivative test.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nCalculate the second partial derivatives:\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nf\_xx = âˆ‚Â²f/âˆ‚xÂ² = 2\textbackslash{}nf\_yy = âˆ‚Â²f/âˆ‚yÂ² = 2\textbackslash{}nf\_xy = âˆ‚Â²f/âˆ‚xâˆ‚y = 0\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nCompute the determinant of the Hessian matrix D = f\_xx * f\_yy {-} f\_xy\^{}2:\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nD = 2 * 2 {-} 0\^{}2 = 4\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nSince D > 0 and f\_xx > 0, the critical point (0, 0) is a local minimum.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nIn conclusion, the function f(x, y) = x\^{}2 + y\^{}2 has a single critical point at (0, 0), which is a local minimum.%

\item[Feedback on Candidate Solution: ]%
The candidate provided a correct conclusion, stating that the critical point (0, 0) is a local minimum. However, they did not show the steps for calculating the first and second partial derivatives, finding the critical points, and applying the second partial derivative test. As a result, they did not achieve points in Steps 1, 2, and 3, but achieved 1 point in Step 4 for correctly determining the nature of the critical point and 1 point in Step 5 for overall structure and thought process.%
