\item[Interviewer Solution: ]%
The primary difference between Supervised and Unsupervised Learning lies in the presence or absence of labeled data. Supervised Learning involves using labeled data to train the model, while Unsupervised Learning uses unlabeled data. In Supervised Learning, the model learns from a dataset that has input{-}output pairs, with the output being the target variable. In Unsupervised Learning, the model learns the inherent structure or patterns within the input data without any target variable. Supervised Learning can be further divided into two categories: Classification and Regression. Classification deals with discrete outputs, whereas Regression deals with continuous outputs. Examples of Classification problems include email spam detection and image recognition, while Regression problems include predicting house prices and stock prices.Unsupervised Learning can be divided into two categories as well: Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction. Clustering involves grouping similar data points based on their features, while Dimensionality Reduction simplifies the dataset by reducing the number of features without losing much information. Examples of Clustering problems include customer segmentation and anomaly detection, while Dimensionality Reduction problems include Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t{-}Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t{-}SNE).An example of a problem that can be solved using Supervised Learning is predicting whether a customer will default on a loan. The dataset would consist of input{-}output pairs, with inputs being features like credit score, income, and loan amount, and the output being the binary target variable (default or no default). The model would be trained on this labeled data and then used to predict the likelihood of default for new customers.An example of a problem that can be solved using Unsupervised Learning is identifying customer segments based on their purchasing behavior. The dataset would consist of unlabeled data, such as purchase history and demographic information. A clustering algorithm, like K{-}means, would be used to group customers into different segments based on the similarity of their purchasing behavior. This information can then be used for targeted marketing campaigns or product recommendations.%

{[}\{'Solution': 'Solution Number 0', 'Remarks': 'The candidate has an excellent understanding of Supervised and Unsupervised Learning, explaining the differences and the use of labeled or unlabeled data, achieving 3 out of 3 points for this criterion. The candidate also provided a clear explanation of categories within Supervised and Unsupervised Learning, with relevant examples, achieving 3 out of 3 points for this criterion. However, the candidate did not provide specific examples of problems that can be solved using Supervised and Unsupervised Learning, which results in 0 points for both the Supervised Learning Problem Example and Unsupervised Learning Problem Example criteria.', 'Score': '6 / 10'\}{]}%
