\item[Problem: ]%
Consider a two{-}player, zero{-}sum game with the following payoff matrix: \textbackslash{}{[} \textbackslash{}begin\{bmatrix\} 2 \& 1 \& 3 \textbackslash{}\textbackslash{} 4 \& 0 \& 6 \textbackslash{}\textbackslash{} 1 \& 5 \& 2 \textbackslash{}end\{bmatrix\} \textbackslash{}{]} Determine the optimal mixed strategies for both players and the value of the game. (Hint: Use the linear programming approach to solve for the mixed strategies and the value of the game.)%

\item[Reference Solution: ]%
To determine the optimal mixed strategies for both players and the value of the game, we will use the linear programming approach. First, let's define the variables and the problem. Let \$x\_1, x\_2, x\_3\$ be the probabilities that player 1 chooses rows 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Similarly, let \$y\_1, y\_2, y\_3\$ be the probabilities that player 2 chooses columns 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The expected payoff for player 1 is given by: \textbackslash{}{[}E = \textbackslash{}begin\{bmatrix\} x\_1 \& x\_2 \& x\_3 \textbackslash{}end\{bmatrix\} \textbackslash{}begin\{bmatrix\} 2 \& 1 \& 3 \textbackslash{}\textbackslash{} 4 \& 0 \& 6 \textbackslash{}\textbackslash{} 1 \& 5 \& 2 \textbackslash{}end\{bmatrix\} \textbackslash{}begin\{bmatrix\} y\_1 \textbackslash{}\textbackslash{} y\_2 \textbackslash{}\textbackslash{} y\_3 \textbackslash{}end\{bmatrix\}\textbackslash{}{]} We want to minimize the expected payoff for player 1, which is equivalent to maximizing the expected payoff for player 2 in this zero{-}sum game. The linear programming problem can be formulated as: \textbackslash{}{[}\textbackslash{}min E = 2x\_1y\_1 + x\_1y\_2 + 3x\_1y\_3 + 4x\_2y\_1 + 6x\_2y\_3 + x\_3y\_1 + 5x\_3y\_2 + 2x\_3y\_3\textbackslash{}{]} subject to: \textbackslash{}{[}x\_1 + x\_2 + x\_3 = 1\textbackslash{}{]} \textbackslash{}{[}y\_1 + y\_2 + y\_3 = 1\textbackslash{}{]} \textbackslash{}{[}x\_i \textbackslash{}geq 0, y\_i \textbackslash{}geq 0, \textbackslash{}forall i \textbackslash{}in \textbackslash{}\{1, 2, 3\textbackslash{}\}\textbackslash{}{]} To solve this problem, we will use the two{-}person zero{-}sum game theorem, which states that there exists an optimal mixed strategy for both players and the value of the game is the same for both players. We can rewrite the linear programming problem as two separate problems: one for player 1 and one for player 2. For player 1, the problem is to minimize E subject to the constraints, and for player 2, the problem is to maximize E subject to the constraints. We can solve these problems using the simplex method or any other linear programming algorithm. The optimal mixed strategies for player 1 are \$(x\_1\^{}*, x\_2\^{}*, x\_3\^{}*) = \textbackslash{}left(\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}frac\{1\}\{3\}, \textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}frac\{1\}\{3\}, \textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}frac\{1\}\{3\}\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}right)\$, and for player 2 are \$(y\_1\^{}*, y\_2\^{}*, y\_3\^{}*) = \textbackslash{}left(0, \textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}frac\{1\}\{2\}, \textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}frac\{1\}\{2\}\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}right)\$. The value of the game is \$V = E(x\^{}*, y\^{}*) = \textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}frac\{10\}\{3\}\$. The optimal mixed strategies for both players are \$(x\_1\^{}*, x\_2\^{}*, x\_3\^{}*) = \textbackslash{}left(\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}frac\{1\}\{3\}, \textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}frac\{1\}\{3\}, \textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}frac\{1\}\{3\}\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}right)\$ and \$(y\_1\^{}*, y\_2\^{}*, y\_3\^{}*) = \textbackslash{}left(0, \textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}frac\{1\}\{2\}, \textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}frac\{1\}\{2\}\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}right)\$, and the value of the game is \$V = \textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}frac\{10\}\{3\}\$.%
